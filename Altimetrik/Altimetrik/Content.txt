EVER.\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings and expand from a peaceful little town to a big bustling metropolis.\n- Don’t forget to decorate your city with famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Space Needle or the Colosseum to give your inhabitants something to be proud of.\n\nThe Place to Be\n- Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like a donut-munching policeman or an uber-macho construction worker (whose real skill is the suggestive eyebrow raise).\n- Already built a fire station? Great! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assign your Bizzies to jobs, where they can collect experience and reward you with valuable resources.\n\nFusion Is the Way to Go\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city in different directions, such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment.\n\nThe Grass Is Always Greener…\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting your friends' cities. You can always “borrow” some ideas, right? … Sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, make sure you visit the Marketplace to earn some extra cash or find that missing upgrade item.\n_____________________________________________\n\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\n\nDon't forget to follow us on social media:\nFacebook: http://gmlft.co/SNS_FB_EN\nTwitter: http://gmlft.co/SNS_TW_EN\nInstagram: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_IG\nYouTube: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_YT\n\nThis app allows you to purchase virtual items within the app and may contain third-party advertisements that may redirect you to a third-party site.\n\nTerms of Use: http://www.gameloft.com/en/conditions-of-use\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice\nEnd-User License Agreement: http://www.gameloft.com/en/eula", "artistId":282764297, "artistName":"Gameloft", "genres":["Games", "Simulation", "Strategy"], "price":0.00, "bundleId":"com.gameloft.citybuilder", "version":"2.0.1", "wrapperType":"software", "userRatingCount":11092},
